The script you provided is designed to capture an image from a webcam, detect contours in the image, and calculate the dimensions of objects within those contours using OpenCV. Here's a breakdown of what the script will do:

Install and Import Required Libraries: The necessary libraries are installed and imported, including OpenCV, NumPy, imutils (for contour handling), SciPy (for distance calculations), and Matplotlib (for image display).

Capture Image from Webcam:

The function capture_image_from_webcam() opens the webcam and continuously reads frames.
It displays the live webcam feed in a window and waits for the user to press the 'c' key to capture the current frame.
The captured frame is saved as captured_image.png and also returned as the output of the function.
Object Dimension Calculation:

The calculate_dimensions() function processes the captured image to detect objects and calculate their dimensions:
It converts the image to grayscale, applies a Gaussian blur, and detects edges using the Canny edge detector.
Contours are extracted from the edges and sorted.
The function then iterates over the contours and processes each one that meets a minimum size requirement (to filter out small, irrelevant contours).
For each contour, the function calculates the minimum bounding box and determines its corner points.
Using the midpoint of these corner points, the function computes the width (dimA) and height (dimB) of the bounding box.
It scales the dimensions using the provided width argument (set to 0.955 in this case, assumed to be the width of a reference object in inches).
Display Results:

The dimensions (width and height) of each detected object are drawn on the image.
The result is displayed using Matplotlib, where the image is shown without axes.
Expected Behavior:
Once you run the script, it will:
Open your webcam feed.
Let you capture an image by pressing the 'c' key.
Once an image is captured, it will analyze the contours in the image, calculate the dimensions of the detected objects (in inches), and display the final image with dimension annotations.
This is useful for measuring real-world objects when you provide a reference object of known dimensions (in this case, width = 0.955 inches).
